# miniProjectStartClassDemo

### This is the project we did together in the class with the following changes:


- “completed” the makeTestData.js method, and added a small check to verify the behaviour of the two virtuals in LocationBlog.js
- Moved DB-initialization values into settings.js, which is where you should add your two db-connection strings.
- Added an incomplete userFacade.js and an empty blogFacade.js which is for you to complete
- Added a test-folder with test-skeleton code in testUserFacade.js and an empty testBlogFacade. These must be completed by you
- Minor NECESSARY changes added to LocationBlog.js.
